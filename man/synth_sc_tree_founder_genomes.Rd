\title{Synthesize Founder Genomes for a Cell Lineage Tree}
\usage{
synth_sc_tree_founder_genomes(
  tree,
  root_genome,
  seg_list,
  mutation_info,
  cell_info
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An igraph object representing the cell lineage tree with vertices as clone types}

\item{root_genome}{List containing the genome sequences for the root clone}

\item{seg_list}{List structure containing segment information for all clones}

\item{mutation_info}{Data frame containing mutation details for all cells}

\item{cell_info}{Data frame containing cell lineage information}
}
\value{
A list containing four elements:
\itemize{
\item all_node_genomes: List of genome sequences for each clone in the tree
\item child_node_founders_df: Data frame containing information about the founder cells for each clone
\item child_node_founder_mutations: List of all mutations in founder cells, organized by clone
\item child_node_founder_mutations_filtered: List of mutations that occurred between parent and child nodes
}
}
\description{
Synthesizes founder genomes for each clone in a cell lineage tree by traversing
the tree from root to leaves, incorporating appropriate mutations and structural
variants at each step.
}
\details{
The function builds genomes sequentially following the evolutionary relationships
defined in the tree structure, ensuring that each clone's genome properly inherits
all modifications from its ancestors plus its unique changes.

# Assuming you have a cell lineage tree and other required objects

  tree = clone_tree,
  root_genome = reference_genome,

  mutation_info = mutations,
