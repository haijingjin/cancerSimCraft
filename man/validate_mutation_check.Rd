\usage{
validate_mutation_check(check_output)
}
\arguments{
\item{check_output}{A nested list structure containing mutation check results,
typically returned by check_genome_mutations()}
}
\value{
Logical value: TRUE if all mutations were correctly introduced,
FALSE if any validation failures were detected
}
\description{
Validates the output from mutation checking functions to ensure all mutations
were correctly introduced into the genome.
}
\details{
This function examines the output from a mutation checking function to verify
that all mutations were correctly introduced into the genome. It:

This function is typically used as a safeguard in genome simulation pipelines
to ensure the integrity of the mutation introduction process.
