\title{Calculate Sizes of Genomic Windows}
\usage{
calculate_window_sizes(genome_window_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome_window_vector}{A character vector of window identifiers in the format
"chr_start_end" (e.g., "chr1_1000_2000")}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the size of each window in base pairs,
calculated as (end position - start position)
}
\description{
Calculates the size (length in base pairs) of each genomic window from a vector
of window identifiers in "chr_start_end" format.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Splits each window identifier into its components
\item Extracts start and end positions
\item Calculates window size as the difference between end and start
}
}
\note{
Assumes window identifiers are properly formatted with underscore separators
and numeric start/end positions
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
windows <- c("chr1_1000_2000", "chr1_2000_5000", "chr2_1000_3000")
sizes <- calculate_window_sizes(windows)
# Returns: c(1000, 3000, 2000)
}

}
