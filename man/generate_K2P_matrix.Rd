\title{Generate Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) Substitution Matrix}
\usage{
generate_K2P_matrix(alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Numeric value representing the transition rate (rate of A<->G and C<->T mutations)}

\item{beta}{Numeric value representing the transversion rate (rate of all other mutations between A, C, G, T)}
}
\value{
A 5x5 matrix with row and column names (A, C, G, T, N) containing substitution
probabilities. The matrix entries represent the probability of transitioning from the row
nucleotide to the column nucleotide.
}
\description{
Generate a Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) Transition Matrix

This function generates a 5x5 transition probability matrix based on the Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model.
The matrix includes transition rates for nucleotides (A, C, G, T) and an additional state (N),
where transitions and transversions are governed by the parameters \code{alpha} and \code{beta}.
}
\details{
The K2P model assumes:
\itemize{
\item Different rates for transitions (alpha) and transversions (beta)
\item Equal base frequencies
\item The 'N' state can only transition to itself
\item No transitions are allowed between any nucleotide and 'N'
}
Matrix entries are normalized by (2*beta + alpha) to ensure proper probability distribution.
}
\examples{
# Generate K2P matrix with transition rate 0.3 and transversion rate 0.1
K2P <- generate_K2P_matrix(alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.1)

}
