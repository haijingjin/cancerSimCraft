\title{Synthesize Founder Genome with Structural Variants}
\usage{
synth_sc_founder_genome(child_node, parent_node, pre_child_genome, seg_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{child_node}{Character string specifying the name of the child clone}

\item{parent_node}{Character string specifying the name of the parent clone}

\item{pre_child_genome}{List containing the genome sequences after SNVs have been incorporated}

\item{seg_list}{List structure containing segment information for all clones}
}
\value{
A list containing the modified genome with structural variants incorporated
}
\description{
Incorporates structural variants (deletions, duplications) into a genome during
the transition from parent to child clone in a cell lineage tree.
}
\details{
This function applies structural variants to a genome during clone evolution by:
\enumerate{
\item Starting with a genome that already has SNVs incorporated (pre_child_genome)
\item Identifying segments that are associated with the specific transition edge
between parent and child clones
\item Processing each relevant segment based on its copy number change (CN_change):
\itemize{
\item For deletions (CN_change = -1): Replaces the original sequence with "N" characters
\item For duplications (CN_change >= 1): Copies the sequence and adds it to the end of the chromosome
}
}

The function works on each haplotype (maternal/paternal) separately and modifies
only chromosomes that have structural variant events associated with the specific
parent-to-child clone transition.

This function is typically called after SNVs have been incorporated into the genome
but before cell-specific mutations are added, representing the genetic changes that
define a new clone's emergence.
