\title{Identify Ancestral Cells in a Lineage}
\usage{
get_sc_ancestors(cell_info, cell_index)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_info}{Data frame containing cell lineage information with columns:
cell_index, parent, and other attributes}

\item{cell_index}{Integer specifying the cell index for which to find ancestors}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the cell indices of all ancestors of the specified cell,
ordered from immediate parent to earliest ancestor
}
\description{
Traces and returns all ancestral cell indices for a given cell by recursively
following the parent relationships in the cell lineage information.
}
\details{
This function traverses the cell lineage tree upward from the specified cell,
following the parent relationships until it reaches a cell with no parent (NA in the parent column).
It builds and returns a vector of all ancestor cell indices encountered during this traversal.

The function is commonly used to reconstruct the complete lineage history of a cell,
which is particularly useful for aggregating mutations or other heritable properties
that are passed down through cell divisions.
