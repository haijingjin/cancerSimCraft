\title{Group Recurrent Mutations by Genomic Location}
\usage{
group_recurrent_mutations(recurrent_mutations)
}
\arguments{
\item{recurrent_mutations}{Data frame containing mutation information with columns:
clone, cell_index, haplotype, chrom, pos, time}
}
\value{
A list where each element is a data frame containing all mutations that
occurred at the same genomic location. List names are constructed as
"haplotype_chromosome_position".
}
\description{
Organizes recurrent mutations by grouping them according to their genomic location
(haplotype, chromosome, and position).
}
\details{
This function takes a data frame of recurrent mutations and organizes them into groups
based on their genomic coordinates. It:
\enumerate{
\item Creates a unique key for each mutation combining haplotype, chromosome, and position
\item Splits the data frame into a list of smaller data frames, each containing
all mutations that occurred at the same genomic location
}

This grouping is useful for analyzing patterns of mutations at specific sites
and for further processing of recurrent mutations in evolutionary analyses.
