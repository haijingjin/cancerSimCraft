\title{Insert Mutations into a Genome}
\usage{
insert_mutations(genome, mutations)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome}{List containing genome sequences organized by haplotype and chromosome}

\item{mutations}{Data frame containing mutation details with columns:
haplotype, chrom, pos, alternative_nt}
}
\value{
The modified genome list with mutations incorporated
}
\description{
This function inserts single nucleotide variants (SNVs) into a genome at specified positions.
It groups mutations by haplotype and chromosome for efficient processing and modifies the genome
sequence accordingly.
}
\details{
The function is designed to be efficient when processing large numbers of mutations
by minimizing the number of times each sequence needs to be modified.
