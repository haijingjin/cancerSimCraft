\title{Sample a Gillespie Event Type}
\usage{
sample_action(total_birth_rate, total_death_rate, total_transition_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{total_birth_rate}{Numeric value representing the sum of all birth rates in the system}

\item{total_death_rate}{Numeric value representing the sum of all death rates in the system}

\item{total_transition_rate}{Numeric value representing the sum of all transition rates in the system}
}
\value{
A character string: either "birth", "death", or "transition" indicating the selected event
}
\description{
Randomly selects an event type (birth, death, or transition) based on the relative rates
of each event in a Gillespie simulation algorithm.
}
\details{
This function implements the event selection step of the Gillespie algorithm.
The probability of selecting each event type is proportional to its rate
relative to the total rate of all events combined.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
total_birth_rate <- 0.5
total_death_rate <- 0.3
total_transition_rate <- 0.2

action <- sample_action(total_birth_rate, total_death_rate, total_transition_rate)
print(action)  # Possible output: "birth"
