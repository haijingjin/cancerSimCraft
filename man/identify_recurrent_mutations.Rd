\title{Identify Recurrent Mutations in Cell Lineage Data}
\usage{
identify_recurrent_mutations(cell_mutations)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_mutations}{Data frame containing mutation information with columns:
clone, cell_index, haplotype, chrom, pos, time}
}
\value{
A data frame containing only the recurrent mutations (mutations that
appear more than once at the same genomic location)
}
\description{
Identifies mutations that occur multiple times at the same genomic location
across different cells in a lineage.
}
\details{
This function identifies recurrent mutations by:
\enumerate{
\item Creating a unique key for each mutation based on its haplotype, chromosome, and position
\item Identifying duplicate keys, which indicate the same mutation occurring multiple times
\item Extracting and returning only the recurrent mutations
}
}
