\title{Retrieve Genomic Segment Information for a Mutation}
\usage{
get_segment_info(seg_list, mutation, in_loss_segment)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_list}{List structure containing segment information for different
clones and haplotypes}

\item{mutation}{Data frame row containing information about a single mutation,
with columns: clone, haplotype, chrom, pos}

\item{in_loss_segment}{Logical indicating whether the mutation is in a segment
that has been lost through deletion}
}
\value{
A data frame row containing the segment information for the mutation,
or NULL if no matching segment is found
}
\description{
Identifies and returns the genomic segment that contains a specific mutation,
handling both regular segments and segments that have been lost through deletions.
}
\details{
This function locates the appropriate genomic segment for a mutation by:
\enumerate{
\item Extracting relevant information (haplotype, chromosome, clone, position) from the mutation
\item Using different search criteria based on whether the segment is lost:
\itemize{
\item For lost segments: Matches chromosome and original coordinates (ori_start/ori_end)
where CN_change is -1 and current coordinates (start/end) are NA
\item For normal segments: Matches chromosome and current coordinates (start/end)
}
\item Returns NULL if no matching segment is found
}

This function is primarily used by simulate_single_nt_change() to map mutations
to their genomic context before simulating nucleotide changes.
