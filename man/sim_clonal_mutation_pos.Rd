\title{Simulate Random Mutation Positions in a Clonal Tree}
\usage{
sim_clonal_mutation_pos(tree, chr_lengths, mutation_number)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An igraph object representing the phylogenetic tree structure.}

\item{chr_lengths}{A nested list containing chromosome lengths for each clone and haplotype:
\itemize{
\item First level: clone names
\item Second level: haplotypes (maternal/paternal)
\item Third level: named numeric vector of chromosome lengths
}}

\item{mutation_number}{A named numeric vector specifying the number of mutations to simulate
for each edge in the tree. Names should be in format "parent_child".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing simulated mutation information:
\itemize{
\item clone - Name of the clone where mutation occurs
\item edge_name - Tree edge identifier (parent_child)
\item haplotype - Maternal or paternal haplotype
\item chrom - Chromosome where mutation occurs
\item pos - Position of mutation on the chromosome
}
}
\description{
Simulates random mutation positions along chromosomes for each edge in a phylogenetic tree.
Mutations are distributed across chromosomes proportionally to their lengths, and can occur
on either maternal or paternal haplotypes.
}
\details{
The function processes the tree in depth-first search order, starting from the first tumor
clone (excluding root). For each edge, it simulates the specified number of mutations by:
\enumerate{
\item Randomly selecting a haplotype (maternal/paternal)
\item Selecting a chromosome with probability proportional to its length
\item Randomly selecting a position within the chosen chromosome
}
}
