\title{Process and Track Recurrent Mutations}
\usage{
process_recurrent_mutation(mutation, mutation_key, tracker)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation}{Data frame containing information about a specific set of recurrent mutations
at the same genomic location}

\item{mutation_key}{Character string uniquely identifying the genomic location of the mutation
(typically in format "haplotype_chromosome_position")}

\item{tracker}{List structure that tracks recurrent mutations by organizing them into
sets based on their occurrence patterns}
}
\value{
Updated tracker list with the mutation properly categorized and stored
}
\description{
Updates a tracker structure that organizes and monitors recurrent mutations
across different lineages, categorizing them as identical, inclusive, or branching.
}
\details{
This function processes recurrent mutations by comparing them to existing mutation sets in a tracker.
It handles three scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item If the mutation set already exists and is identical, it returns the tracker unchanged.
\item If the mutation set is a superset of an existing set, it updates the existing set with new mutations.
\item If the mutation set is distinct from existing sets, it creates a new branch in the tracker.
}

The function prints the relationship category for debugging and monitoring purposes.
