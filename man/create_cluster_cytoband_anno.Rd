\title{Create Cytoband Annotations for Region Clusters}
\usage{
create_cluster_cytoband_anno(region_clusters, cytoband_mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{region_clusters}{A nested list structure containing clustered genomic regions.
The list is organized by haplotype ("maternal"/"paternal"), then by chromosome,
then by cluster number, containing region IDs as the innermost elements.}

\item{cytoband_mapping}{A list containing cytoband annotations for each genomic region.
Each element should be named with a region ID corresponding to those in region_clusters.}
}
\value{
A nested list with the same structure as region_clusters, where each cluster
contains a data frame of unique cytoband annotations. The structure is:
list[haplotype][chromosome][cluster] -> data frame of cytoband annotations
}
\description{
Maps clustered genomic regions to their corresponding cytoband annotations for both
maternal and paternal haplotypes. For each cluster of regions, the function collects
and combines the cytoband annotations of all regions within that cluster.
}
\details{
The function processes clusters by:
\enumerate{
\item Iterating through haplotypes (maternal/paternal)
\item For each chromosome in each haplotype
\item For each cluster in each chromosome
\item Retrieving and combining cytoband annotations for all regions in the cluster
\item Removing duplicate annotations using unique()
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming region_clusters and cytoband_mapping are already defined:
cluster_annotations <- create_cluster_cytoband_anno(
  region_clusters = region_clusters,
  cytoband_mapping = cytoband_mapping
)

# Access annotations for a specific cluster:
maternal_chr1_cluster1 <- cluster_annotations[["maternal"]][["chr1"]][[1]]
}
