\title{Create a Cell Lineage Tree Visualization}
\usage{
create_sc_tree_plot(
  dynamic_sim_ob,
  clone_colors,
  title = "SC Dynamics Dendrogram"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dynamic_sim_ob}{List object returned by simulate_sc_dynamics function}

\item{clone_colors}{Named vector of colors where names match clone types in the simulation}

\item{title}{Character string for the plot title, defaults to "SC Dynamics Dendrogram"}
}
\value{
A ggraph plot object displaying the cell lineage tree with customized styling
}
\description{
Creates a dendrogram visualization of cell lineage data from simulation results,
showing the relationships between cells and their clonal evolution over time.
}
\details{
This function creates a dendrogram visualization of cell lineage data where:
\enumerate{
\item The vertical axis represents time
\item Edges represent cells' lifespans
\item Edge colors indicate the clone type of each cell
\item Branch lengths correspond to cell lifetimes
}

The function first prepares the cell information data using the prepare_tree_data function,
then creates a graph object and finally generates a dendrogram visualization using ggraph.
The resulting plot has publication-ready styling with customized title, legend, and axis labels.
}
\examples{
# Define colors for each clone type
clone_colors <- c(A = "blue", B = "red")

# Create and display the lineage tree
tree_plot <- create_sc_tree_plot(dynamic_sim_ob, clone_colors, "Cell Lineage Evolution")
print(tree_plot)

# Save the plot
ggsave("cell_lineage_tree.png", tree_plot, width = 10, height = 8)
