\title{Collect All Mutations for Each Clone in Tree}
\usage{
acquire_clone_mutations(mutation_table, tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_table}{A data frame containing mutation information with columns:
\itemize{
\item edge_name - Tree edge identifier in format "parent_child"
\item other mutation-specific columns
}}

\item{tree}{An igraph object representing the phylogenetic tree structure}
}
\value{
A list where:
\itemize{
\item Names are clone names (excluding root)
\item Values are data frames containing all mutations affecting each clone,
including those inherited from ancestors
}
}
\description{
Gathers all mutations that occur along the evolutionary path from root to each clone
in the phylogenetic tree. This includes mutations from all ancestral branches.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies the root node and all other clones in the tree
\item For each clone:
\itemize{
\item Finds all edges in the path from root to clone
\item Collects mutations occurring on these edges
\item Returns mutations in their original table format
}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# For a tree with path Root -> A -> B
clone_muts <- acquire_clone_mutations(mutation_table, tree)
# clone_muts$B will contain mutations from both Root->A and A->B edges
}
}
