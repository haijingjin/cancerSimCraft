\usage{
synth_clone_genome(
  target_clone,
  nearest_genome,
  nearest_clone,
  tree,
  seg_list,
  mut_table,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_clone}{Character. Name of the clone whose genome is to be synthesized.}

\item{nearest_genome}{Nested list containing the nearest ancestor's genome sequences:
\itemize{
\item First level: haplotypes (maternal/paternal)
\item Second level: chromosomes with nucleotide sequences
}}

\item{nearest_clone}{Character. Name of the nearest ancestor clone.}

\item{tree}{igraph object. Phylogenetic tree structure.}

\item{seg_list}{Nested list containing segment information for all clones:
\itemize{
\item First level: clone names
\item Second level: haplotypes
\item Each haplotype contains segment information (data frame)
}}

\item{mut_table}{Data frame containing mutation information with columns:
\itemize{
\item edge_name - Tree edge identifier
\item other mutation-specific columns required by introduce_snv
}}
}
\value{
A nested list containing the synthesized genome with the same structure
as nearest_genome, but updated with all genomic changes.
}
\description{
Constructs a clone's genome by applying sequential genomic alterations (CNVs, WGDs)
and mutations (SNVs) starting from a nearest ancestral genome. Processes events along the
evolutionary path between the nearest ancestor and target clone.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies edges between nearest ancestor and target clone
\item For each edge:
\itemize{
\item Processes segment changes (copy number variations)
\item Handles segment losses (marks with "N")
\item Adds new segments for gains
\item Applies SNVs if present
}
\item Maintains separate tracking for maternal and paternal haplotypes
}
