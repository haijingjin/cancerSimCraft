\title{Select a Clone Type for an Event}
\usage{
pick_action_cell(population, action_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{Named numeric vector containing the current population count for each clone type}

\item{action_rate}{Named numeric vector containing the per-cell rate for the action for each clone type}
}
\value{
A character string representing the name of the selected clone type
}
\description{
Selects a clone type on which an event (birth, death, etc.) will occur based
on the population size and action rate of each clone type.
}
\details{
This function implements the clone type selection step in the Gillespie algorithm.
The probability of selecting a particular clone type is proportional to its
population multiplied by its action rate. This ensures that more abundant clones
and clones with higher rates are more likely to be selected.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
population <- c(Clone1 = 10, Clone2 = 5)
action_rate <- c(Clone1 = 0.1, Clone2 = 0.05)

selected_clone <- pick_action_cell(population, action_rate)
print(selected_clone)  # Possible output: "Clone1"
