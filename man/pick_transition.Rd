\title{Select a Transition Event Between Clone Types}
\usage{
pick_transition(population, edge_transition_rates)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{Named numeric vector containing the current population count for each clone type}

\item{edge_transition_rates}{Data frame with columns: parent, child, rate - specifying transition probabilities
between clone types}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item transition_clone: Character string representing the name of the target clone type (the clone to which the cell transitions)
\item edge_transition_rates: Updated data frame of transition rates with the selected
transition's rate set to zero
}
}
\description{
Selects a specific transition event between clone types based on the current
population and edge transition rates, then updates the transition rate matrix
to prevent the same transition from occurring again.
}
\details{
This function implements the transition selection step in the Gillespie algorithm for
cell clone type transitions. The probability of selecting a particular transition is
proportional to the population of the parent clone multiplied by the transition rate.
After selection, the transition rate for the selected transition is set to zero,
indicating it can only occur once in the simulation.

\examples{
# Population counts
pop <- c(A = 100, B = 50, C = 30)

# Define transition matrix
transitions <- data.frame(
  parent = c("A", "B", "A"),
  child = c("B", "C", "C"),
  rate = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.005)
)

# Select and process a transition event
result <- pick_transition(pop, transitions)
result$transition_clone  # The selected target clone
result$edge_transition_rates  # Updated transition matrix
